### Built with
- [WebTorrent]

- [Normalize.css]
- [Moment.js]
- [ui-grid]
- [pretty-bytes]
- [ng-file-upload]

Website powered by [jsDelivr] and [CloudFlare]. I use [nginx] in my server.

Don't like CloudFlare? No problem! Check [Direct-βTorrent]. Don't like my server either? Check [RawGit]

### Easily built, tested and served
**I use [Harp] to rapidly test and compile the project**

Build the project into HTML, JS and CSS easily. Just use:
```bash
harp compile
```
This will create a www folder with the compiled files

If you need to serve the files and view the compiled version instantly just use:
```bash
harp server
```

### Enable Debugging
Enable βTorrent (Debug logging) and WebTorrent (Logs logging) debug logs by running this in the developer console:
```js
localStorage.debug = '*'
```
Disable by running this:
```js
localStorage.removeItem('debug')
```
